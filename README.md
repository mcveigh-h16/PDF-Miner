PC based jupyter notebook, to extract lines of text from pdf file by page number, convert it into a format for taxonomy update and merge mycobank data. Output saved to excel. Data rows are modified at several steps to created desired output. Final output saved as excel. Opportunity for improvement by dropping some of the extra columns.
